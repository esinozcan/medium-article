  <p>User-centered design (UCD) is a framework that places the user at the center of the design and development process. It focuses on who'll be using a product, the tasks they need to complete while using the project, and the environment in which they'll use the product (i.e., a product’s context of use).</p>

  <p>UCD addresses the whole user experience and aims to improve human well-being by creating products that are useful, usable, and accessible. This is achieved through focusing on usability and employing a user-driven evaluation and iteration process.</p>

  <p>In this article, I’ll desribe 5 principals for successful user-centered design.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <h1>1. Design for the users and their tasks</h1>
      <p> You need to first understand your users – their needs and objectives – in order to create an interface that allows them to effectively access your system’s functionality. </p>

      <p> The important questions to ask then in creating a user-centered interface are: Who are the users? What are the main functions that the user will need? Why is the user using this particular piece of software/hardware and what are their goals? </p>

      <h1>2. Maintain Consistency</h1>
      <p>The users need a system that is easy to learn with minimal and understandable requirements.   The behavior of interface elements should be consistent.</p>
      <p>This consistency between product design elements contribute to reducing the learning effort required to understand how the design works and how to use it properly.</p>

      <h1>3. Provide Adequate Feedback</h1>
      <p><span>Users need assurance that their actions have been successfully executed. </span>This can be made evident by a change in the appearance when completion is achieved successfully.</p>

      <h1>4. Use Simple and Natural Dialogue</h1>
      <p> The user should see only the relevant information that is essential for task completion because each time irrelevant information is added, it puts the user in a more complicated situation.</p>

      <h1>5. Be Error Free</h1>
      <p><span> Minimize errors by directing the users towards the right way to achieve their goals. </span> Feedback from users should be constrained to prevent error, where necessary to the task.</p>
      <p>Consider expressing error messages in plain language to avoid the use of codes and offer a solution suggestion to the problem.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>While the site’s visual aesthetics are important, the key factors for determining a website’s success are its usability and utility. Now that we know the principles, let's work towards building a world with better interfaces!</p>
